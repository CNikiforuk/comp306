Hallucinogen-Related Disorders

with dread of insanity or death. Many hallucinogenic substances have stimulant ef-
fects (e.g., tachycardia, mild hypertension, hyperthermia, and pupillary dilation) and
may cause some of the features of Amphetamine Intoxication. The percephlal distur-
bances and impaired judgment associated with Hallucinogen Intoxication may result
in injuries or fatalities from automobile accidents, physical fights, or attempts to "fly"
from high places. Environmental factors and the personality and expectations of
the individual using the hallucinogen may contribute to the nature and severity of
Hallucinogen Intoxication. Intoxication may also be associated with physiological
changes, including increases in blood glucose, cortisol, ACTH, and prolactin. Hallu-
cinogen Persisting Perception Disorder may produce considerable anxiety and con-
cern and may be more common in suggestible persons. It remains controversial
whether the chronic hallucinogen use produces a Psychotic Disorder de novo, trig-
gers psychotic symptoms only in vulnerable persons, or is simply an early and con-
tinuing sign of an evolving psychotic process. Hallucinogen Abuse and Dependence
also frequently occur in persons with preexisting adolescent Conduct Disorder or
adult Antisocial Personality Disorder. 150 intoxication may be confirmed by urine
toxicology.
Specific Culture, Age, and Gender Features
Hallucinogens may be used as part of established religious practices such as peyote
in the Native American Church. Within the United States, there are regional differ-
ences and changes in patterns of use over the decades. Hallucinogen Intoxication
usually first occurs in adolescence, and younger users may tend to experience more
disruptive emotions. Hallucinogen use and Intoxication appear to be three times
more common among males than among females.
Prevalence
Hallucinogens came into vogue in tlle United States in the 1960s. Over the ye.1rs, a va-
riety of these agents have been popular, but in the 1990s the two most commonly used
drugs of this class have been LSD and MDlvtA. lt is estimated that the peak preva-
lence of intake of hallucinogens in the United States was between 1966 and about
1970, with a subsequent decline, but there is some evidence of a modest increase be-
giruling in approximately 1990.
According to a 1996 national survey of drug use, 10% of people aged 12 and older
acknowledged ever having used a hallucinogen. The age group reporting the highest
proportion who had ever used one of these drugs was 18- to 25-year-olds (16%), in-
cluding 7% in the past year and 2% in the prior month. Among high school seniors,
data from a 1997 national survey indicated that 15% acknowledged ever having taken
a hallucinogen, including 10% in the prior year. It should be noted that because these
surveys measured patterns of use rather than disorders, it is not known how many of
those in the survey who used hallucinogens had symptoms that met the criteria for
Dependence or Abuse.
A 1992 conununity survey conducted in the United States reported lifetime rates
of Hallucinogen Abuse or Dependence to be about 0.6%, with a 12-month prevalence
rate of about 0.1%.Substance-Related Disorders
Course
Hallucinogen Intoxication may be a brief and isolated event or may occur repeatedly.
The intoxication may be prolonged if doses are frequently repeated during an epi·
sode. Frequent dosing, however, tends to reduce the intoxicating effects because of
the development of tolerance. Depending on the drug and its route of administration,
peak effects occur within a few minutes to a few hours, and intoxication ends within
a few hours to a few days after dosing ends. The high prevalence of "ever haVing
used" hallucinogens among those ages 26-34 years and the lower prevalence of re-
cent use in that group suggest that many individuals may stop using hallucinogens
as they get older. Some individuals who use hallucinogen report "flashbacks" that are
not associated with any impairment or distress. On the other hand, flashbacks can
cause impairment or distress in some individuals (Hallucinogen Persisting PerceJr
tion Disorder; see above).
Differential Diagnosis
For a general discussion of the differential diagnosis of Substance-Related Disorders,
see p. 207. Hallucinogen-Induced Disorders may be characterized by symptoms (e.g.,
delusions) that resemble primary mental disorders (e.g., Schizophreniform Disorder
versus Hallucinogen-Induced Psychotic Disorder, With Delusions, With Onset Dur-
ing Intoxication). See p. 210 for a discussion of this differential diagnosis.
Hallucinogen Intoxication should be differentiated from Amphetamine or Phen-
cyclidine Intoxication. Toxicological tests are useful in making this distinction. in-
toxication with anticholinergics can also produce hallucinations, but they are often
associated with physical findings of pupillary dilation, fe\'er, dry mouth and skin,
flushed face, and visual disturbances. Hallucinogen Intoxication is distinguished
from the other Hallucinogen·Induced Disorders (e.g., Hallucinogen-Induced Anxi-
ety Disorder, With Onset During Intoxication) because the symptoms in these latter
disorders are in excess of those usually associated with Hallucinogen Intoxication
and are severe enough to warrant independent clinical attention.
Hallucinogen Intoxication is distinguished from Hallucinogen Persisting Percep-
tion Disorder mashbacks) by the fact that the latter continues episodically for weeks
(or longer) after the most recent intoxication. In Hallucinogen Persisting Perception
Disorder, the individual does not believe that the perception represents external real-
ity, whereas a person with a Psychotic Disorder often beUeves that the perception
is real. Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder may be distinguished from
migraine, epilepsy, or a neurological condition by neuro-ophthalmological history,
physical examination, and appropriate laboratory evaluation.

Inhalant-Related Disorders
This section includes disorders induced by inhaling the aliphatic and aromatic hydro-
carbons fOW'ld in substances such as gasoline, glue, paint thinners, and spray paints.
Less commonly used are halogenated hydrocarbons (found in cleaners, typewriter
correction fluid, spray-<:an propellants) and other volatile compounds containing es-
ters, ketones, and glycols. The active ingredients include toluene, benzene, acetone,
tetrachloroethylene, methanol, and other substances. Reflecting different modes of
action and profiles of associated problems, disorders arising from the use of anesthet-
ic gases (e.g., nitrous oxide, ether) as weU as short-acting vasodilators (e.g., amyl and
butyl nitrate ("poppers"]) are described instead under Other (or Unknown) Sub-
stance-Related Disorders on p. 294. Most compounds that are inhaled are a mixture
of several substances that can produce psychoactive effects, and it is often difficult to
ascertain the exact substance responsible for the disorder. Unless there is dear evi-
dence that a single, unmixed. substance has been used, the general term inhalallt
should be used in recording the diagnosis. These volatile substances are available in
a wide variety of commercial products and may be used interchangeably, depending
on a\'ailabitity and personal preference. Although there may be subtle differences
in the psychoactive and physical effects of the different compounds, not enough is
known about their differential effects to distinguish among them. All are capable of
producing Dependence, Abuse, and Intoxication.
Several methods are used to inhale intoxicating vapors. Most commonly, a rag
soaked with the substance is applied to the mouth and nose, and the vapors are
breathed in-a process called "huffing." The substance may also be placed in a paper
or plastic bag and the gases in the bag inhaled-a procedure calJed "bagging." Sub-
stances may also be inhaled directly from containers or from aerosols sprayed in the
mouth or nose. There are reports of individuals heating these compounds to acceler-
ate vaporization. The inhalants reach the lungs, bloodstream, and target sites very
rapidly.
This section contains discussions specific to the Inhalant-Related Disorders. Texts
and criteria sets have already been provided for generic aspects of Substance Depen-
dence (p. 192) and Substance Abuse (p. 198) that apply across all substances. The ap-
plication of these general criteria to Inhalant Dependence and Abuse is provided
below. However, there are no unique criteria sets for Inhalant Dependence or Inhal-
ant Abuse. A specific text and criteria set for Inhalant Intoxication is also provided
below. Tolerance has been reported among individuals with heavy use. Although
withdrawal-like symptoms have been seen in animals after repeated exposure to
trichloroethane, it has not been established. that a clinically meaningful withdrawal
syndrome occurs in humans. For this reason, the diagnosis of inhalant withdrawal is
not included in this manual. The Inhalant-Induced Disorders (other than Inhalant
Intoxication) are described in the sections of the manual with disorders with which258
Substance-Related Disorders
they share phenomenology (e.g., Inhalant-Induced Mood Disorder is included in
the "Mood Disorders" section). Listed below are the Inhalant Use Disorders and the
Inhalant-Induced Disorders.

Inhalant Use Disorders
304.60
Inhalant Dependence
Refer, in addition, to the text and criteria for Substance Dependence (see p. 192). Some
of the generic Dependence criteria do not apply to inhalants, whereas others require
further explanation. Tolerance to the effects of inhalants has been reported among
individuals with heavy use, although its prevalence and clinical significance are un-
known. A possible mild withdrawal syndrome has been reported but has not been
well documented and does not appear to be clinically significant. Thus, Inhalant De--
pendence includes neither a characteristic withdrawal syndrome nor evidence of
inhalant use to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. However, inhalants may be
taken over longer periods of time or in larger amounts than was originally intended,
and individuals who use them may find it difficult to cut down or regulate inhalant
use. Because inhalants are inexpensive, legal- and easily available, spending a great
deal of time attempting to procure inhalants would be rare. However, substantial
amounts of time may be spent on using and recuperating from the effects of inhalant
use. Recurrent inhalant use may result in the individual giving up or reducing impor-
tant social, occupational, or recreational activities, and substance use may continue
despite the individual's knowledge of phYSical problems (e.g., liver disease or central
and peripheral nervous system damage) or psychological problems (e.g., severe de-
pression) caused by the use.305.90

Inhalant Abuse
Specifiers
The following specifiers may be applied to a diagnosis of Inhalant Dependence (see
p. 195 for more details):
Early Full Remission
Early Partial Remission
Sustained Full Remission
Sustained Partial Remission
In a Controlled Environment
305.90
Inhalant Abuse
Refer, in addition, to the text and criteria for Substance Abuse (see p. 198). Individuals
who abuse inhalants may use them in hazardous circumstances (e.g., driving an au-
tomobile or operating machinery when judgment and coordination are impaired by
Inhalant Intoxication). Users can also become agitated and even violent during intox-
ication, with subsequent legal and interpersonal problems. Repeated intake of inhal-
ants may be associated with family conflict and school problems (e.g., truancy, poor
grades, dropping out of school) or difficulties at work.
Inhalant-Induced Disorders
292.89
Inhalant Intoxication
Refer, in addition, to the text and criteria for Substance Intoxication (see p. 199). The
essential feature of Inhalant Intoxication is the presence of clinically significant mal-
adaptive behavioral or psychological changes (e.g., confusion, belligerence, assault-
iveness, apathy, impaired judgment, impaired social or occupational functioning)
that develop during, or shortly after, the intentional use of, or short-term, high-dose
exposure to, volatile inhalants (Criteria A and B). The maladaptive changes are ac-
companied by signs that include dizziness or visual disrurbances (blurred vision or
diplopia), nystagmus, incoordination, slurred speech, an lmsteady gait, tremor, and
euphoria. Higher doses of inhalants may lead to the development of lethargy and
psychomotor retardation, generalized muscle weakness, depressed reflexes, stupor,
or coma (Criterion C). The disturbance must not be due to a general medical condi-
tion and is not better accounted for by another mental disorder (Criterion D).Substance-Related Disorders

counted for by another mental disorder.
Other Inhalant-Induced Disorders
The following Inhalant-lllduced Disorders are described in other sections of the man-
ual with disorders with which they share phenomenology: Inhalant Intoxication De-
lirium (p. 143), Inhalant-Induced Persisting Dementia (p. 168), Inhalant-Induced
Psychotic Disorder (p. 338), Inhalant-Induced Mood Disorder (p. 405), and Inhalant-
Induced Anxiety Disorder (p. 479). These disorders are diagnosed instead of Inhalant
Intoxication only when the symptoms are in excess of those usually associated with
Inhalant Intoxication and when the symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant in-
dependent clinical attention.
